  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A steak is a thick cut of meat sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, or cooked in sauce, as in steak and kidney pie.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pat dry - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Season generously - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sear steaks - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).
    </li>
    <li>
      Add butter and aromatics - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
    </li>
  </ol>
